Greenery version 1.0 11/03/2017

The Greenery app encourages people to walk rather than take the car or
public transport. It helps users start or maintain an active lifestyle
and decrease air pollution & greenhouse gas emissions.

The app counts your steps, and shows how much CO2 you've prevented
from being released into the atmosphere. It also shows how many
calories you've burned.
